###Kivy + PyGuitarPro + Spotify + Music Theory

![](images/screen1.jpg)

Create a fretboard visualization with a GuitarPro5 file (.gp5) and a Spotify premium account.

Get your Spotify token here: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user/
with user-modify-playback-state scope access. Paste into spt_connect_user.py.

Two experimental versions: run kivy_app.py or fretless.py.

Spotify should be actively playing something before running either and pressing
PLAY.
